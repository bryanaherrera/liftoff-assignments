# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Picture this, you’re at an event having a good time and you have this one song in your head that you want everyone to enjoy, a song request for the DJ. You look for the DJ but they’re up on a platform a little far away. However you notice that there is a QR code around that mentions if you have a song request to submit it there. You scan the code and are taken to a song request application, this is Play That Song. An application where guests can send in song requests and DJs can see what the audience wants to listen to. Users can upvote a song to get it higher on the queue and send custom messages directly to the DJ. The DJ can indicate what songs have already been played from the queue and decide if the song is appropriate for the event. The DJ can also see the most requested songs of the night to get an idea of what is wanted for a similar event in the future. I DJ on the weekends sometimes and I always ask the hosts of the event what kind of music they would like to listen to. That doesn’t take into account the audience that will be there. I have my classic songs that have to be played but it’ll be nice to know what the audience wants to hear. It is as well hard to hear when a bunch of people come up to the DJ booth asking for songs all at once. I also don’t like when people come to the booth due to the fact that they might have open drinks that could damage the equipment. This application is a solution to that, the audience can inform the DJ of their song preferences and the DJ can spin without their groove being interrupted.
### Features
Submit a request - Users can submit and add a song to the queue
DJ login - DJs can create an account or log in to create an event for guests to send requests to
View data - DJ users can see the top songs played in the event, over serval events, and on specific criteria (after mvp)
### Technologies
Vue or Angular, Spring Boot, MySQL, Java
### What I'll Have to Learn
I anticipate learning a new technology and/or mastering and learning more about technologies I have some knowledge in. I also anticipate learning more JavaScript, especially when it comes to up voting a song and moving it up the queue
